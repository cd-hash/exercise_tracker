# FCC Exercise Tracker

## This project is built to pass the test implemented by FCC

If you would like to read the tests or implement your own version you can go to the [FreeCodeCamp Exercise-Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker) page.
